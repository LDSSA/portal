    <h4 class="pb-3">Welcome to the admissions for the Lisbon Data Science Starters Academy!</h4>
    <p>
        We will soon invite you to the admissions channel on the batch 9 slack where you can contact us in case of trouble. 
        You can also contact us on the email admissions@lisbondatascience.org. It can happen that some emails sent by us 
        land in your spam folder or take longer to deliver.
    </p>

    <p>
        Before you start, please read all the details about the LDSSA 
        <a href="https://ldssa.github.io/wiki/Starters%20Academy%20(LDSSA)/01-Starters-Academy-(Course)/">here</a>, 
        about this admissions process <a href="https://ldssa.github.io/wiki/Applicants/Application-process/">here</a>, 
        and keep these main points in mind:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li class="pb-3">
            Students need an average of <b>10 hours per week</b> to study the learning materials during the academy.
            It can get a bit more in the first specialization and some parts of the capstone.
            The bootcamp classes and the hackathons are not included in this time commitment. The two bootcamp days 
            are 4 hour events and the hackathons are 9-10 hours long.
        </li>
        <li class="pb-3">
            <b>The Starters Academy will have both a remote and in-person option this year.</b>
            This should only be reflected in the Hackathons, where a batch of students will have the opportunity to 
            meet and do hackathons in-person, and other students can do it remotely. 
            The choice to do in-person or remote is done when applying for the course. 
            The in-person option will open only if a sufficient amount of students chooses this option.
        </li>
        <li class="pb-3">
            Since our Academy is based in Lisbon, all the Starter's Academy activities will happen during the day, 
            <b>Lisbon time</b>. This includes the bootcamp classes, the hackathons, and instructors' availability 
            to answer questions on Slack. <b>Remote students are required to be online during the bootcamp and 
            the hackathons.</b>  For students who are in very different timezones, this probably means that they'll 
            have to join us at unusual hours, and that communicating with instructors will feel very async. 
            Please take this into consideration when applying!
        </li>
        <li class="pb-3">
            You can find all the relevant dates for the Starter's Academy on this 
            <a href=https://ldssa.github.io/wiki/Starters%20Academy%20(LDSSA)/01-Starters-Academy-(Course)/>Webpage</a>.
            <b>The bootcamp and the first and last hackathons are mandatory</b>. 
            If you cannot complete the first specialization and the first hackathon, you won't be allowed to join any other 
            course activities and won't be able to graduate. If you cannot complete the last hackathon, you won't be able 
            to continue with the capstone project.
            In order to participate in the hackathons, you're required to achieve a minimum score of 80% in all the 
            learning units of that specialization. You have to complete all the learning units to graduate, but you can miss
            one hackathon (except for the first and the last).
        </li>
        <li class="pb-3">
            At the end of the Starters Academy, we will emit a Lisbon Data Science Starters Academy Certificate that will describe your achievements.
            This certificate will list all the Starters Academy's specializations, explain what it means to pass each specialization, and show the grades that you've achieved in each of them.
            If you miss a specialization, you'll score 0 (zero) on that specialization, and this will be shown in your certificate.
            You'll only be issued a Lisbon Data Science Starters Academy Certificate in case you miss one or zero hackathons.
            The Bootcamp days, Specialization 1, Hackathon 1, and the Capstone cannot be missed.
        </li>
        <li class="pb-3">

                        <p>For the <b>coding test</b>, you can submit it for grading as many times as you want, but once you start it, <b>you only have {{ ADMISSIONS_CODING_TEST_DURATION_HOURS }} hours to finish it</b>.
                        Start the coding test only when you have {{ ADMISSIONS_CODING_TEST_DURATION_HOURS }} hours of free and uninterrupted time. </p>
                        
                        <p>The coding test and SLUs require setting up your local environment with a virtual environment and be able to run Jupyter notebooks.
                        Follow the setup instructions in points 2 and 4 <a href="https://github.com/LDSSA/batch-admissions">here</a>. If you are not familiar with Jupyter notebooks, refer to SLU00 of the <a href="https://github.com/LDSSA/ds-prep-course-2024">prep course</a>.

                        See instructions in point 5 on how to run a Jupyter notebook.
                        
                        We <strong>strongly suggest that you complete the SLUs before starting the coding test</strong>.
                        This way, you'll set up your local environment without any time constraints and get familiar with the grading system, leaving you better prepared to face the coding test!</p>
