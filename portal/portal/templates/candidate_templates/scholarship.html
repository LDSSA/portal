    <p>
      In this batch of the Lisbon Data Science Starters Academy, we’ll have 10 seats for people who live with no / low income and therefore <br>
      can’t afford paying the normal fees (which are 250€ for student tickets, 500€ for regular tickets and 1500€ for company tickets).<br>
      The scholarship seats have a symbolic 20€ fee.
    </p>

    <p>
      The process that we’ll use to decide whether to grant a scholarship is the following:
      <ul>
        <li>
          The candidate will start by reading these terms and conditions carefully, and confirm that they accept them.
        </li> <br>
        <li>
          The candidate will work on the admission tests.
        </li><br>
        <li>
          If the candidate doesn't pass the admission tests, the admission process is over and they won’t be accepted in the LDSSA.
        </li><br>
        <li>
          If the candidate passed the admission tests, and there are less than 10 scholarship candidates who passed the test, the candidate <br>
          will automatically move on to the next phase. If there are more than 10 scholarship candidates who passed the test, the candidate will go <br> 
          through a random selection process to decide whether they will move on to the next phase. This random selection follows the same <br>
          <a href="https://ldssa.github.io/wiki/Applicants/Application-process/">entrance type restrictions</a> as the non-scholarship one.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          If the candidate passed the selection phase, the next phase is a video call with a staff member of the Academy. The goal of the video call<br>
           is for us to learn why the candidate needs a scholarship. It will be helpful for us to make the decision if the candidate has documentation <br>
           that proves their no / low income situation, although this is not mandatory. This video call will be led by an interviewer who will collect<br>
            the data that the candidate is comfortable sharing with us, by writing a report in a document shared with the candidate. At the end of <br>
            the video call, the candidate will be asked to read the interviewer’s report and to sign it (by writing their full name at the bottom of <br>
            the shared document). The actual decision will be made by the Academy’s executive team, based only on the content of the report.
        </li><br>
        <li>
          In case the scholarship is granted, the candidate will have 48h to pay the 20€ fee and submit their payment proof. The payment proof will be <br>
          validated by a staff member of the Academy, and in case it’s valid, the candidate is accepted in the batch of the LDSSA.
        </li><br>
        <li>
          If a candidate doesn’t pass the interview phase or doesn't pay the fee, the next candidates in line will be called for the interview. So, even if <br>
          a candidate is not called for a first round of interviews, they might still be called for a second or third one.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      If less than 10 scholarships are granted, the remaining seats will be filled by non scholarship candidates.
    </p>

    <p><b>
      If a candidate decides to apply for a scholarship at the beginning of the admission process, they won’t be able to change this at any time <br>
      during the process! If the scholarship is denied, they won’t be able to pay the normal fee and get in through the normal admissions funnel.
