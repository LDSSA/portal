            </p>
            <p>
                After downloading the SLUs, setup your local environment, so that you can run the the Jupyter notebooks.
                See the setup instructions below.
            </p>
            <p>
                You should go through the notebooks in this order:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <code>Learning Notebook</code>: here we'll teach you the basics of <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/">Pandas</a>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>Examples Notebook</code>: here you'll find a summary of the methods that you've learned in the <code>Learning Notebook</code>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>Exercise Notebook</code>: here you'll find the exercises that you should complete and submit.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                Once you're done with the three notebooks, you should upload your <code>Exercise Notebook</code> for grading 
                in the submission box below.
            </p>

            </p>

            <p>
                In order to run the notebooks, you need to:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Have Python 3.12 installed in your machine.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Create a Python virtual environment.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Install the requirements listed in the <code>requirements.txt</code> in your virtual env 
                        (note: it is paramount that the packages that you install <br> have the exact same version as 
                        in the <code>requirements.txt</code> file, because those are the versions that we're using 
                        to grade your notebooks).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Be able open a Jupyter Notebook and run code there.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Avoid using vscode, it might make the notebook grading fail.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                If you know what you're doing, the above instructions should be enough.
                Otherwise, we have a guide that explains how to set up <br> a Python environment 
                and install requirements <a href="https://github.com/LDSSA/batch-students/">here</a>. 
                Follow the setup instructions in part <b>2. Initial Setup</b> and <b>4. Setup for all operating systems - <br> Python virtual environment</b>.
                See instructions in sections <b>3.2</b> and <b>3.3</b> of part <b>5. LDSSA learning units workflow</b> on how to run a Jupyter notebook. <br>
                Ignore the rest of the setup for now. If you are not familiar with Jupyter notebooks, refer to SLU00 of the <a href="https://github.com/LDSSA/ds-prep-course-2025">prep course</a>.

                Alternatively, you can achieve the same by using Anaconda:

                <h2>Submitting your work for grading</h2>
            </p>

            <p>
                After you've completed the <code>Exercise Notebook</code>, 
                you'll need to submit it for grading and get a score of at least 16 (out of 20).
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>You should upload the <code>Exercise Notebook</code> with your solutions directly</strong>. 
                You don't need to create a zip file or submit anything else!
            </p>

            <p>
                After you submit, you'll see the grade of your submission, and whether you passed or not.
                You can click in "Open" in the Feedback column to see how much you scored in each question.
            </p>

            <p>
                You can make as many submissions as you like until the due date. So take your time to work on this assignment. :)
            </p>
