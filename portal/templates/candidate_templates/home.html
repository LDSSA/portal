    <h4 class="pb-3">Welcome to the admissions for the Lisbon Data Science Starters Academy!</h4>
    <p>
        Thank you for your interest in participating in the next <b>batch of the LDSSA!</b><br>
        Before you start, please read all the details about the LDSSA <a href="https://ldssa.github.io/wiki/Starters%20Academy%20(LDSSA)/01-Starters-Academy-(Course)/">here</a>, about this admissions process <a href="https://ldssa.github.io/wiki/Applicants/Application-process/">here</a>, and keep these main points in mind:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li class="pb-3">
            In order to get the most out of the experience, students should spend an average of <b>10 hours per week</b> (and no less than 5 hours per week) studying on their own time for each specialization.
            The Bootcamp and the end of specialization Hackathons are not included in this time commitment, as these are full 10 to 12 hour day events
            The three weeks after the Bootcamp and the Capstone project are heavier in terms of workload, so the necessary time commitment will likely be higher than 10 hours per week.
        </li>
        <li class="pb-3">
            <b>The Starters Academy will have both a remove and in-person option this year.</b>
            This should only be reflected in the Hackathons, where a batch of students will have the opportunity to meet and do hackathons in-person, and other students can do it remotely. The choice to do in-person or remote is done when applying for the course.
        </li>
        <li class="pb-3">
            Since our Academy is based in Lisbon, all the Starter's Academy activities will happen during the day, <b>Lisbon time</b>.
            This includes the Bootcamp, Hackathons, and instructors' availability to answer questions on Slack.
            <b>Students are required to be online during the Bootcamp and Hackathons.</b>
            For students who are in very different timezones, this probably means that they'll have to join us at unusual hours,
            and that communicating with instructors will feel very async. So please take this into consideration when applying!
        </li>
        <li class="pb-3">
            You can find all the relevant dates for the Starter's Academy on this <a href=https://ldssa.github.io/wiki/Starters%20Academy%20(LDSSA)/01-Starters-Academy-(Course)/>Webpage</a>.
            The Bootcamp and first Hackathon are mandatory: if you miss them, you're not allowed to join any other activities in the course and won't be able to graduate.
            For all the Hackathons, in order to participate you're required to have a minimum score of 80% on the Learning Units of that specialization.
        </li>
        <li class="pb-3">
            At the end of the Starters Academy, we will emit a Lisbon Data Science Starters Academy Certificate that will describe your achievements.
            This certificate will list all the Starters Academy's specializations, explain what it means to pass each specialization, and show the grades that you've achieved in each of them.
            If you miss a specialization, you'll score 0 (zero) on that specialization, and this will be shown in your certificate.
            You'll only be issued a Lisbon Data Science Starters Academy Certificate in case you miss one or zero hackathons.
            The Bootcamp days, Hackathon #1, Specializations, and the Capstone cannot be missed or delivered late.
            If you can't attend one of the remaining specializations you're allowed to deliver all the evaluation elements for that specialization (Learning Units + Hackathon) until the end of the following month, and it won't count as a missed specialization in the certificate.
        </li>
        <li class="pb-3">
            Everyone is expected to comply with our <a href="https://ldssa.github.io/wiki/About%20us/Code-of-Conduct/">Code of Conduct</a> in all the interactions with the Lisbon Data Science Academy.
            This includes the candidates applying to the Starters Academy.
            During this admissions process, <b>we'll ask you to read and acknowledge this Code of Conduct and you'll only be allowed to continue if you agree.</b>

                        <p>For the Small Learning Units, you can start them at any time, submit them for grading as many times as you want, and the due date will always be the {{ ADMISSIONS_SELECTION_START }}.
                        For the coding test, you can also submit it for grading as many times as you want, but once you start it, <b>you only have {{ ADMISSIONS_CODING_TEST_DURATION_HOURS }} hours to finish it</b>.</p>

                        <p>Make sure that you only start the coding test when you have enough free and uninterrupted time to spend.
                        Also, we <strong>strongly suggest that you complete SLU01 before starting the coding test</strong>.
                        This way, you'll setup up your local environment without any time constraints and get familiar with the grading system, leaving you better prepared to face the coding test!</p>
