        <h2>You're about to start the coding test.</h2>
        <p>Once you start it, you'll only have <b>{{ ADMISSIONS_CODING_TEST_DURATION }} hours</b> to complete it.<br>
            You can make as many submissions as you want, and you only need 1 passing submission (at least <b>{{ coding_test_subtype.pass_score|floatformat }}</b> out of <b>{{ coding_test_subtype.max_score|floatformat }}</b> points).
        </p>
        <p>We'll only consider your <b>best</b> submission, not your last one.</p>
        <p>
            Your time will start once you click the button below, and it can't be stopped.
            So make sure you're free for the next {{ ADMISSIONS_CODING_TEST_DURATION }} hours!
        </p>

        <p><h4>
            Please complete the setup from SLU01 before starting the coding test, 
            or you'll be wasting your precious test time setting up your environment!!!
